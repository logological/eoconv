SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------

eoconv requires Perl 5.6 or higher.  It should run on any system that
runs this version of Perl, though it's been tested only on Unix-like
systems.


INSTALLATION
------------

At the moment no automatic installation is provided.  Simply copy the
eoconv.pl file to somewhere in your path (e.g., /usr/local/bin).
Documentation in various formats is available in the `doc'
subdirectory.  Note that the script assumes that your Perl
installation is in /usr/bin/perl; if you have Perl installed
elsewhere, you will need to edit the first line of the script.


RUNNING
-------

Simply run eoconv.pl from the command line.  Brief help is available
with the --help command-line option; a detailed man page is available
with the --man command-line option.
